There's a solution for you.\nJust look at the required block and enter the [b]/get[/b] command into the chat and it will instantly appear in your active hotbar slot.\n\n[h1] Why not the middle mouse button? Scrap Mechanic API doesn't support keybindings for mods, but if they add support for them in the future, I'll definitely implement it.
